	<h2 style="background-color: #b3ccff; color:white">3 Types of JavaScript Outputs</h2>
	<h3>innerHTML</h3>
	<p id="demo"></p>
	<script>
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
	</script>
	<p>In the code, it says "innerHTML = 5 + 6;" meaning the javascript does the math part and changes the value.

	<h3>document.write</h3>
	<script>
		document.write(5 + 6);
	</script>
	<p>document.write is another way to write down, in the code it says "document.write(5 + 6);" which is just telling the code to put down whatever is in the parenthesis.

	<h3>Window Alert</h3>
	<p>The output will appear in a popup window ( shows when you first open the website ).</p>
	<script>
		window.alert(5 + 6);//window alert
	</script>
